## Buy me a coffee

Every software has its flaws, but until they're fixed, I'm here to help rev up your workflow. If these scripts make your life easier, consider buying me a coffee!

## Scripts

### ðŸ“¦ Blender Isolated Mesh Rendering

#### Setup & Usage
1. Ready your scene and camera
2. Create collections for your meshes (rendering will be processed using the collections range identified in the script)
3. Modify settings in the script for your need, change the rendering engine, set collections range in the array, enable or disable transparency
4. Run the script

1. Extract scripts to CEP/extensions (or anwhere if you need one time use)
2. In Illustrator go to File->Scripts->Other
3. Locate your folder and run 'extract-text.jsx'
4. Save your JSON file to the script folder as 'large_file.jsx'
5. Open Command Prompt
6. Change working directory to script folder's directory
7. Type 'python translator.py' to run Python script, then enter your Google Cloud API and your target language code (e.g. es, en)
8. Your translated file will be placed in script folder.
9. In Illustrator, go to File->Scripts->Other and run 'import-text.jsx' in scripts folder. It will directly replace original text in your artboards.
